# PYTHON THREAD COMMUNICATION
* PYTHON provides mechanisms for threads to communicate with each other.
* EVENT is a communication mechanism between threads,
* A wait call is made to create a blocking thread, BLOCKING: whose execution 
  will be halted
* A set() call releases all the blocking threads and continues execution.
* The operations must be for the same Event object
