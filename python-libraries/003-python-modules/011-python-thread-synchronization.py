# PYTHON THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION
* This program demonstrates the PYTHON thread synchronization mechanisms 
  (this is about Thread conflict and deadlock resolution)
* THREAD CONTENTION: two processes trying to use the same resource 
  at the same time        
* Threads might share the same resource and in such cases there could be 
  various contention issues (who should use the resource first.)
* A resource here could be anything from a variable to a file or any thing that 
  must be used sequentially.
* LOCKS: One solution to overcome this issue is using LOCKS.
* Python Locks supports locked and unlocked states, a lock will have EXCLUSIVE 
  access to the shared resource during the lock period, 
  this will prevent contention 
* lock can be acquired using the "acquire()" function and unlock can be issued 
  using release() function.
* PYTHON semaphores, acquire() semaphore.release()
* SEMAPHORES are one more mechanism to implement synchronization,
* They have an internal counter which starts to decrement when an acquire() call  
  is made and starts to increment when a release() call is made. The counter  
  will never go below zero; but when it is zero, it blocks, waiting for a thread  
  to call the release()
* They are very useful to manage Database connection pools, File writing 
  services and situations where precaution needs to be taken when the shared 
  resource has limited capacity.
