Variables and Operations in Python

In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They provide a way to give names to values, making the code more readable and manageable. Variables can hold various types of data, such as numbers, text, and more complex data structures.

Assigning Values to Variables
To assign a value to a variable, you use the assignment operator =. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
age = 25
name = "Alice"
In this example, the variable age is assigned the value 25, and the variable name is assigned the value "Alice".

Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, including:

Integers (int): Whole numbers without decimal points.
Floating-Point Numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points.
Strings (str): Sequence of characters, such as text.
Boolean (bool): Represents either True or False.
Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries: More complex data structures to store collections of values.
Operations
Python supports various operations that you can perform on variables and values. Some common operations include:

Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations.
python
Copy code
addition = 5 + 3
subtraction = 10 - 4
multiplication = 3 * 7
division = 15 / 3
String Concatenation: Combining strings.
python
Copy code
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
Comparison Operators: Used to compare values.
python
Copy code
x = 10
y = 5
greater_than = x > y
equal_to = x == y
Logical Operators: Used to combine and manipulate boolean values.
python
Copy code
a = True
b = False
logical_and = a and b
logical_or = a or b
Expressions and Statements
Expressions are combinations of values and operators that can be evaluated to produce a result. Statements are lines of code that perform actions. Assignments and arithmetic operations are examples of statements.

Example: Using Variables and Operations
python
Copy code
# Variable assignment
width = 10
height = 5

# Arithmetic operations
area = width * height
perimeter = 2 * (width + height)

# String concatenation
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"

# Comparison and logical operations
x = 7
y = 12
is_greater = x > y
logical_result = (x < 10) and (y > 5)
These are the basics of working with variables and performing operations in Python. They form the foundation for building more complex programs and algorithms.
