# Simple single IF..ELSE conditional statement syntax
A = 100
B = 100
C = 200

# Check if A = B, and print a message
if A == B:
    print('A and B are same !') # This message will be printed

# Check if B = C, and print a message
if B == C:
    print('B and C are same !') # This will NOT be printed

# Print with ELSE condition
if B == C:
    print('B and C are same !') # This will NOT be printed
else:
    print('B and C are NOT same !') # This will be printed
