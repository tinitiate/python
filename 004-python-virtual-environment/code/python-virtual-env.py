# Python Virtual Environment
* Virtual Environment is a project setup mechanism where, the modules required
  for that project are isolated from the system installed modules.
* It is good practice to have one new virtual environment for every Python 
  project, this helps in module dependencies isolation between projects.
* Steps to follow
  * Step 1. Install the virtualenev module using; `pip install virtualenv`
  * Step 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment; `virtualenv my_project`
  * Step 3. Optional, select python compiler version
    * for Python 3
